# Mod 1 Lab - Basic Python

## Part 1 – Solo – hello.py
1) Add the following to hello.py :
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
 
## Part 2 – Group – stats.py

### stats.py
Implement 4 functions:
* `compute_mean(collection, n)`
   * Returns the mean of all items `collection` rounded to `n` decimal points (hint - look up "rounding in Python") 

* `compute_median(collection)`
   * Returns the median of all items in `collection`
   * When there are an even number of items, return the lower of the two middle numbers. This is how we will define the median in algorithms throughout this course.

* `compute_mode(collection)` 
   * Returns the mode of all items in `collection`
   * When there are multiple potential modes, return the lowest 

* `compute_stats(collection)`
   * Returns a three-tuple of the mean, median, and mode of a collection
## External Modules
**Do not use any imported modules (`math`, `collections`, ...) when implementing functionality.** It is okay to use imported modules for testing.

It is okay to import modules you write yourself; e.g. any data structures you write yourself.
